# MathLab

== Description ==

This is a 6 question math quiz, in other words, the easiest math quiz on the internet. I just took some Year 5 math word problems and calculated
them on Javascript using console.logs and by stating the variables. In addition, the two pages have been designed and styled with HTML/CSS/JS
